# Simple photo gallery for the traveller

Generates a static fullscreen photo website from a bunch of photos.

## Install

- clone this repo
- buy the [galleria.io](http://galleria.io/) fullscreen theme
- copy it into ``assets/galleria``

## Source

Put photo files into ``src`` and rename them according to the schema
``[id]_[title]_[description].jpg``. Title and Description are optional.

Run ``rake check`` to find potential troubles.

## Compile

``rake compile``

Images in the gallery will be ordered by id reverse. The idea is to use the file names generated by
your digital camera, e.g. ``P1002384.jpg`` or ``IMG_7495.jpg``. So the photos will be in reverse
chronological order by default.

## Deploy

Copy the resulting ``bin`` directory to your web server
